
 there are several other filtering and prioritization mechanisms:
1. Geographic/Regional Filtering System
Tier-based Country Prioritization:
•	Tier 1 Countries: England, Spain, Italy, Germany, France (highest priority)
•	Tier 2 International: World, Europe (international competitions)
•	Tier 3 Other Popular: Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, USA, United Arab Emirates
Country Order Priority:
JavaScript
Copy
const POPULAR_COUNTRIES_ORDER = [
  'International', // FIFA Club World Cup first
  'World', // Men's international friendlies
  'Europe', // UEFA competitions
  'South America', // CONMEBOL competitions
  'Egypt', 'USA', 'United Arab Emirates',
  'England', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'France',
  // Other countries...
];
2. League-Specific Filtering by Country
Each country has specific allowed leagues:
•	England: Premier League (39), FA Cup (45), EFL Cup (48)
•	Spain: La Liga (140), Copa del Rey (143)
•	Italy: Serie A (135), Coppa Italia (137)
•	Germany: Bundesliga (78), DFB Pokal (81)
•	France: Ligue 1 (61), Coupe de France (66)
•	Brazil: Serie A-D (71, 72, 73, 74)
•	USA: Only MLS (253) and MLS Next Pro (254)
3. Exclusion Filtering System
Centralized Exclusion Filter (shouldExcludeFixture):
•	Filters out unwanted leagues like Oberliga, USL W League, WPSL, NPSL, etc.
•	Excludes women's competitions and youth leagues
•	Removes lower-tier domestic competitions
Additional Popular League Exclusions:
JavaScript
Copy
// Extra filtering for popular leagues card
if (leagueName.includes('oberliga') || 
    leagueName.includes('usl w league') || 
    leagueName.includes('wpsl') ||
    leagueName.includes('npsl') ||
    // ... more exclusions
   ) {
  return false;
}
4. USA-Specific Filtering
Very restrictive filtering for USA leagues:
JavaScript
Copy
if (fixture.league.country?.toLowerCase() === 'usa') {
  const allowedUSALeagues = [253, 254]; // Only MLS and MLS Next Pro
  if (!allowedUSALeagues.includes(fixture.league.id)) {
    return false;
  }
}
5. International Competition Detection
Multiple layers of international competition identification:
•	World Friendlies: Men's international friendlies (excludes women's)
•	CONMEBOL: Copa America, Libertadores, Sudamericana
•	UEFA: Champions League, Europa League, Conference League
•	FIFA: World Cup, Club World Cup
6. Date-Based Filtering
Strict date matching to ensure only matches from the selected date are shown:
JavaScript
Copy
const fixtureDate = parseISO(fixture.fixture.date);
const fixtureDateString = format(fixtureDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd');
const matchesSelectedDate = fixtureDateString === selectedDate;
7. Time Filter Mode
When timeFilterActive is true, the component consolidates all matches into a single time-ordered list with different sorting:
•	Live matches first (sorted by start time)
•	Upcoming matches second (sorted by nearest time)
•	Finished matches last (sorted by most recent)
8. Country-Specific Permissiveness
Different filtering strictness by country tier:
•	Tier 1: Show all major leagues for the country
•	Tier 3 Brazil/Egypt: More permissive (multiple divisions allowed)
•	Other Tier 3: Very restrictive (only specific leagues)
9. Popular Team Consideration
The component defines popular teams for potential match prioritization:
JavaScript
Copy
const POPULAR_TEAMS = [
  // Premier League teams
  33, 40, 42, 50, 47, 49, // Man United, Liverpool, Arsenal, etc.
  // La Liga teams  
  529, 541, 530, 548, 727, // Barcelona, Real Madrid, etc.
  // Serie A, Bundesliga teams...
];
10. Caching and Performance Filters
•	Smart caching with 30-45 minute cache times
•	Batch processing of league requests (3 leagues per batch)
•	Background refresh for better UX
•	Deduplication of fixtures across different data sources
