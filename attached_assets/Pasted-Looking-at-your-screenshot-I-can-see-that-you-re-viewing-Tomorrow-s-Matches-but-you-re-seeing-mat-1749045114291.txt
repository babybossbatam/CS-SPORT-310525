Looking at your screenshot, I can see that you're viewing "Tomorrow's Matches" but you're seeing matches with 00:00 kick-off times. This is actually the expected behavior based on our current smart date filtering system. Let me explain what's happening:

The Current Time Range Logic
Our system currently uses the time range 00:01:00 - 23:59:59 for "today's matches", which means:

00:00:xx (midnight) is deliberately excluded from "today"
00:00:xx matches are classified as "tomorrow's matches"
Why You're Seeing 00:00 Matches in Tomorrow's Tab
When you select "Tomorrow's Matches", the system:

Sets the reference date to tomorrow's date
Applies the perspective-based filtering where tomorrow becomes the "today" reference
Uses the 00:01:00 - 23:59:59 range for that reference date
Includes 00:00:xx matches because they fall into tomorrow's date range
The Workflow Explanation
Here's what happens step by step:

User selects "Tomorrow's Matches"

selectedDate = tomorrowString (e.g., "2025-01-19")
referenceDate = parseISO(selectedDate) (tomorrow's date)
Smart Date Labeling Process:

// In MyDateConversionFilter.filterFixturesForDateSmart()
const referenceDate = parseISO(selectedDate); // Tomorrow's date
smartResult = MySmartDateLabeling.getSmartDateLabel(
  fixtureDate, 
  matchStatus, 
  undefined, 
  referenceDate  // Uses tomorrow as reference
);
Perspective Shift:

Tomorrow's date becomes the "today" reference
Matches on tomorrow with 00:00:xx are included
Matches on the day after tomorrow become "tomorrow" from this perspective
Why This Makes Sense
This behavior is actually logical because:

00:00 is technically the start of the new day
When viewing "Tomorrow's Matches", you want to see all matches scheduled for tomorrow
Midnight matches (00:00) are indeed tomorrow's matches, not today's
Visual Evidence in Your Screenshot
The matches you're seeing:

Mauritius vs Zimbabwe - 00:00
Angola vs Namibia - 00:00
Zambia vs Comoros - 00:00
These are all correctly classified as tomorrow's matches because they're scheduled at midnight (start of tomorrow).

This is working as designed - the 00:00 exclusion from "today" ensures that midnight matches appear in the correct date tab (tomorrow) rather than being ambiguously classified.
