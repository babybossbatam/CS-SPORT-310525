i found the issue:

maybe our smart filtering issue is filter out the match because of the date
because of wrong conversion date make it become wrong day.
so this is how we will fix the issue:

create a new file name it MyUpdatedFixtureDateSelection and this file function is to when we get the API fixture by selected date then store it in cached storage database.
the raw data will be convert to client local time zone and the format we use is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss
to define what is Today's Matches fixtures we need to compare our local Timezone after converted. with time range like this :
for Today it start from 2025-06-18T00:00:00 - 2025-06-18T23:59:59
for yesterday time it start from 2025-06-17T00:00:00 - 2025-06-17T23:59:59
for tomorrow time it start from 2025-06-19T00:00:00 - 2025-06-19T23:59:59
