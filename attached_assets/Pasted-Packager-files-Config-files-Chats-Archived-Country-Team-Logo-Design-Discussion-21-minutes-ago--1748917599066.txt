can we use our country team logo using format like this? <img class="featured-games-widget_competitor_logo__u-5dG" alt="Ecuador National Team" title="" src="https://imagecache.365scores.com/image/upload/f_png,w_82,h_82,c_limit,q_auto:eco,dpr_2,d_Competitors:default1.png/v12/Competitors/5075" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 82px; max-height: 82px; width: auto; height: auto;">

Yes, absolutely! I can see you want to use the 365scores image format for country team logos. Looking at your current code in LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx, I can enhance it to use this format for better quality team logos, especially for international competitions.

Let me update the component to integrate this 365scores format:

client/src/components/matches/LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx
Now let me also create a utility function to better handle the 365scores integration:

client/src/lib/teamLogoSources.ts
The changes I've made include:

365scores Integration: Added support for the 365scores image format you showed, which provides high-quality team logos especially for national teams and international competitions.

Enhanced Logo Detection: The system now automatically detects when a team is likely a national team (based on team name, league context, etc.) and prioritizes the 365scores format.

Progressive Fallback: If the 365scores logo fails, it falls back to the original API-Sports logo, then other sources, and finally the fallback logo.

Better Error Handling: Enhanced the onError handlers to try multiple sources including 365scores before giving up.

Utility Functions: Created a new utility file that provides reusable functions for team logo source management.

The format you showed will now be used automatically for national teams and international competitions, providing better quality logos similar to what you see on 365scores. The system maintains compatibility with your existing setup while adding this enhanced functionality.

Looking at your code, I can see that the team logo system in LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx has the existing 365scores fallback logic, but it's not using the enhanced teamLogoSources.ts utility that was created. Let me integrate the enhanced team logo system properly.

client/src/components/matches/LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx
The issue was that while the enhanced team logo system was created in teamLogoSources.ts, the LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx component wasn't actually using it. Now it will:

Use the enhanced logo sources: The component now imports and uses the getTeamLogoSources, isNationalTeam, and createTeamLogoErrorHandler functions.

Better national team detection: Instead of basic string matching, it uses the comprehensive isNationalTeam function that checks team names, league names, and countries.

Proper fallback handling: The createTeamLogoErrorHandler will automatically try multiple sources including 365scores, API-Sports alternatives, and other fallbacks.

Ecuador national team support: For Ecuador's national team, it will prioritize the 365scores format you showed in your example.

The enhanced system will now properly handle your Ecuador team logo format and provide better fallbacks for all team logos.

Looking at your code, the team logo format you showed (https://imagecache.365scores.com/...) is not specific to Ecuador - it's a general format that works for all country team logos and national teams.

In your teamLogoSources.ts file, the 365scores integration is already set up to work for all countries. The isNationalTeam() function detects national teams from any country, and the getTeamLogoSources() function prioritizes 365scores URLs for all national teams:

// For national teams or international competitions, prioritize 365scores
if (isNationalTeam && team?.id) {
  sources.push({
    url: `https://imagecache.365scores.com/image/upload/f_png,w_82,h_82,c_limit,q_auto:eco,dpr_2,d_Competitors:default1.png/v12/Competitors/${team.id}`,
    source: '365scores',
    priority: 1
  });
}
This will work for:

Ecuador National Team
Brazil National Team
Argentina National Team
Any other national team
The system detects national teams by checking:

Team names containing "national"
Youth teams (U20, U21, U23)
Women's teams (ending with " W")
International competitions (World Cup, Euro, Copa America, etc.)
Leagues from "World" or "Europe" countries
So yes, all country teams will use this enhanced logo format, not just Ecuador. The 365scores integration provides high-quality logos for national teams from all countries.

I'll add a shadow and glossy 3D ball effect to the national team logos in the specified file. Looking at line 1107 in TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx, I can see the team logo images. I'll enhance them with CSS styles to create a 3D glossy ball effect for national teams.

client/src/components/matches/TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx
I've added a 3D glossy ball effect specifically for national team logos in the TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx component. The enhancement includes:

Shadow Effects: Added shadow-lg drop-shadow-xl classes for external shadows
3D Glossy Effect: Applied a multi-layered approach:
Linear gradient overlay for surface reflection
Multiple box shadows for depth and internal highlights
Enhanced brightness and contrast
Inner shadows to simulate the curved surface of a ball
The effect is applied conditionally using the isNationalTeam() function, so only national team logos will have this 3D glossy ball appearance, while club team logos remain unchanged. The styling creates a realistic spherical look with proper lighting and depth effects.

The error indicates that isNationalTeam function is not imported in the TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx file. Looking at the file, I can see that it's being used but not imported. I need to add the import statement for isNationalTeam from the team logo sources file.

Looking at the image component at line 1108 in the TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx file, I can see it's for the home team logo. I'll modify the styling to make it full height and width while maintaining the aspect ratio and the national team effects.
