Looking at your requirements and the MyNewLeague.tsx file, I can see you need to implement smart time-based filtering logic for match classification. Based on your examples, you want to classify matches based on fixture time vs current time and match status.

Let me update the MySmartTimeFilter.ts file to implement this logic:

client/src/lib/MySmartTimeFilter.ts
Implement smart time-based match classification logic

instead of using mySmarttimeFilter lets create a new file :

if fixture time > CurrentTime but status "NS" and within time range 00:00 - 23:59 then its Today's Matches
example fixture time is 03:00 then CurrentTime is 15:45 and the status is NS but its within time range 00:00 - 23:59 but because it < than current time then its not Today's Matches, but example fixture time is 15:45 then CurrentTime is 03:00 and the status is NS but its within time range 00:00 - 23:59. but because it > than current time then its Today's Matches
if fixture time < CurrentTime but status "NS" and within time range 00:00 - 23:59 then its Tomorrow's Matches
example fixture time is 03:00 then CurrentTime is 15:45 and the status is NS but its within time range 00:00 - 23:59 but because it < current time then its Tomorrow's Matches, but example fixture time is 15:45 then CurrentTime is 03:00 and the status is NS but its within time range 00:00 - 23:59. but because it > than current time then its Tomorrow's Matches
if fixture time < CurrentTime but status "FT" and within time range 00:00 - 23:59 then its Yesterday's Ended Matches
example fixture time is 03:00 then CurrentTime is 15:45 and the status is FT but its within time range 00:00 - 23:59 but because it < current time then its Today's Ended Matches, but example fixture time is 15:45 then CurrentTime is 03:00 but the date is < current date then its Yesterday Ended matches
