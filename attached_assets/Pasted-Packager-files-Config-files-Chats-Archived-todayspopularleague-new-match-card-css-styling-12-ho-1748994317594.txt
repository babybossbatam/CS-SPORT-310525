do we hardcode all the datetime filter to check the date feom server to client? can we make a new file instead of hardcode and just import it? lets name our new file to handle the timefiler for this MydateConversionFilter

Looking at your codebase, I can see you have datetime filtering logic scattered across multiple files. You're right that creating a centralized file would be much cleaner. Let me create a new MydateConversionFilter.ts file that consolidates all the datetime filtering and conversion logic.

client/src/lib/MydateConversionFilter.ts
Now let's update the LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx component to use this new centralized date filtering utility:

client/src/components/matches/LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx
I've created a comprehensive MydateConversionFilter.ts file that centralizes all your datetime filtering and conversion logic. This file includes:

Key Features:

Core Date Conversion: UTC to client timezone conversions
Relative Date Checks: Today, yesterday, tomorrow validations
Fixture Filtering: Advanced timezone-aware fixture matching
Multi-timezone Support: Date range generation for comprehensive coverage
Safe Utilities: Error-handling wrappers for date operations
Legacy Compatibility: Maintains existing function signatures
Benefits:

No More Hardcoding: All datetime logic is centralized
Consistent Behavior: Same timezone handling across components
Easy Maintenance: Single place to update date logic
Better Performance: Optimized date calculations
Type Safety: Proper TypeScript definitions
You can now import specific functions or the default export from @/lib/MydateConversionFilter in any component that needs datetime filtering. The functions are organized by category and well-documented for easy usage.

I'll help you add logic to handle date ranges for today, tomorrow, and yesterday in your LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx component. Looking at your existing code and the MydateConversionFilter.ts file, I can see you already have the utilities needed for this.

I'll update the filtering logic to include time-based filtering for specific date ranges:

client/src/components/matches/LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx
The changes I've made:

Added useMemo import to optimize the filtering performance
Added date range filtering logic that:
Only applies when timeFilterActive is true
Creates date ranges for today, tomorrow, and yesterday (00:00:00 - 23:59:59)
Filters fixtures to only include matches within these three date ranges
Uses your existing MydateConversionFilter.parseDate utility for safe date parsing
The logic now handles:

Today: Current date from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59
Tomorrow: Next day from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59
Yesterday: Previous day from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59
This will ensure that when the time filter is active, only matches from these three specific date ranges are displayed, giving users a focused view of recent, current, and upcoming matches.

I'll help you create a live fallback page that matches the design you've shown. I'll update the NoLiveMatchesEmpty component to match your design and modify the live match components to use it properly.

Updated NoLiveMatchesEmpty component with:

Custom SVG soccer goal illustration with orange player figures
Gray background with proper spacing

Looking at the image you provided, I can see that all the UEFA Nations League - Women matches are showing "01:00" as the match time. Let me check what the server is actually returning for these fixtures to understand the time format and data.

Based on the console logs and the current live fixtures endpoint, I can see that the server is fetching live fixtures, but to check the specific time data for those UEFA Nations League Women matches, I'll need to examine what's being returned from the API.

Looking at the code structure and the server routes, the match times are coming from the RapidAPI service. The time "01:00" that you're seeing in the UI suggests these matches are scheduled for 1:00 AM.

Let me check the server response format and the date conversion logic:

The time display is handled in the LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx component and other match components. Looking at the server logs, I can see fixtures are being fetched successfully. The "01:00" time you're seeing is likely the UTC time being converted and displayed.

From the server routes, I can see that fixture data includes:

fixture.date - the full datetime string from the API
fixture.status - the match status
The time "01:00" is being extracted from the API response and displayed. This appears to be the correct UTC time for those UEFA Nations League Women matches. The server is receiving this data from RapidAPI and the frontend is displaying it as formatted time using format(fixtureDate, "HH:mm").

If you want to verify what exact time data the server is receiving, you could add some console logging to see the raw fixture.date values being returned from the API for these specific matches.

You're absolutely right! The issue you're seeing with matches showing "01:00" instead of proper time display is because the server is sending UTC time, but the client needs to convert it to the user's local timezone to properly determine if a match is today, tomorrow, or yesterday.

Looking at your screenshot, those matches are showing "01:00" which suggests they're scheduled for 01:00 UTC, but in the user's timezone they might actually be happening on a different day.

Let me enhance the MydateConversionFilter.ts to better handle timezone conversions and then update the LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx to use proper client timezone logic:

client/src/lib/MydateConversionFilter.ts
Now let's update the LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx component to use proper timezone-aware filtering:

Looking at your request, you want to add "United-Arab-Emirates" with hyphens to the regional filter in TodayPopularLeagues. I can see from the code context that this is likely related to the TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx component's filtering logic.

Let me check the current filtering implementation and add "United-Arab-Emirates" to the popular countries list:

client/src/components/matches/TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx
Add United-Arab-Emirates to POPULAR_COUNTRIES list
see that both Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia flags are failing to load from both SportsRadar and 365scores sources. The server is logging:

❌ Both SportsRadar and 365scores flags not found for country: Hong-Kong - will be added to exclusion list
❌ Both SportsRadar and 365scores flags not f

the API is returning country names with hyphens (Hong-Kong, Saudi-Arabia) but the country code mapping only had the space versions (Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia). Now both variations are mapped to their correct country codes:

Hong-Kong and Hong Kong → HK
Saudi-Arabia and Saudi Arabia → SA

added "United-Arab-Emirates" (with hyphens) to the POPULAR_COUNTRIES_ORDER array in addition to the existing "United Arab Emirates" (with spaces). This ensures that regardless of whether the API returns the country name with spaces or hyphens, it will be included in the regional filter for the Popular Leagues component.

The filtering logic in the component checks if the country name includes any of the popular countries, so having both variations will ensure "United-Arab-Emirates" matches are properly included in the regional filter.

Looking at the usage in LiveMatches.tsx, I can see that the component is used in the context where we need to manage the live filter state. Let me update the NoLiveMatchesEmpty component to accept an additional prop for handling the live filter deactivation.

client/src/components/matches/NoLiveMatchesEmpty.tsx
Now I need to update the LiveMatches.tsx component to pass the live filter deactivation function. Looking at the LiveMatches component, I can see it uses Redux to manage state, so I need to add the dispatch action to deactivate the live filter.

so this NoLiveMatchesEmpty no need to import it to LiveMatchByAllCountry?

BA

compitobatam
Assistant
15 hours ago
Looking at the current code, you're correct. The NoLiveMatchesEmpty component doesn't need to be imported into LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx.

The NoLiveMatchesEmpty component is currently being used in:

LiveMatches.tsx - where it shows when there are no live matches
Potentially other components that handle empty states
The LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx component has its own empty state handling at the bottom:

if (!allFixtures.length) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardContent className="p-6 text-center">
        <Activity className="h-8 w-8 mx-auto mb-2 text-gray-400" />
        <p className="text-gray-500">No live matches available</p>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
This is a simpler, inline empty state that's appropriate for this component. The NoLiveMatchesEmpty component is more elaborate with illustrations and navigation buttons, which is better suited for full-page empty states like in the LiveMatches page.

So no, you don't need to import NoLiveMatchesEmpty into LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx. The current implementation is correct - each component handles its empty state appropriately for its context.

why you import it to liveMatches page? since we use LiveMatchbyAllCountry on our pages

BA

compitobatam
Assistant
15 hours ago
You're absolutely correct! Looking at the code structure, the NoLiveMatchesEmpty component is imported and used in the LiveMatches.tsx page, but this page is a standalone live matches page.

However, in your main application flow, you're using LiveMatchForAllCountry component within other pages like through TodayMatchPageCard.tsx. The LiveMatchForAllCountry component already has its own simple empty state handling:

if (!allFixtures.length) {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardContent className="p-6 text-center">
        <Activity className="h-8 w-8 mx-auto mb-2 text-gray-400" />
        <p className="text-gray-500">No live matches available</p>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  );
}
The NoLiveMatchesEmpty component with its elaborate UI (stadium illustration, "See All Matches" button, etc.) is specifically designed for the dedicated LiveMatches page where users land when they specifically want to see live matches.

For the LiveMatchForAllCountry component that's embedded within other pages, the simpler empty state is more appropriate since users are already on a page with other content and don't need the elaborate empty state with navigation buttons.

So the current implementation is correct:

LiveMatches.tsx (standalone page) → uses NoLiveMatchesEmpty
LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx (embedded component) → uses simple inline empty state
You don't need to import NoLiveMatchesEmpty into LiveMatchForAllCountry.tsx.

thats why i want to change the simple empty state handling to the NoLiveMatchesEmpty

Looking at the "By time" button in TodayMatchPageCard.tsx at line 239, I can see what data it displays when pressed.

When the "By time" button is clicked, it triggers the timeFilterActive state. Based on the conditional rendering logic at the bottom of the component, here's what gets displayed:

Button States and Data Display:
When timeFilterActive is true and liveFilterActive is false (time only):

Displays the TodayMatchByTime component
Shows matches for the selectedDate grouped by time slots
Data includes all fixtures for that date organized chronologically
When both timeFilterActive and liveFilterActive are true (combined state):

Displays the LiveMatchByTime component
Shows only live matches grouped by time slots
Data includes live fixtures with real-time updates
When timeFilterActive is false:

Returns to the default view showing:
TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew (popular leagues)
TodaysMatchesByCountryNew (matches grouped by country)
Specific Data from TodayMatchByTime:
From the code analysis, when the "By time" button activates TodayMatchByTime, it displays:

Query: Fetches fixtures using /api/fixtures/date/${selectedDate}?all=true
Data Structure: All matches for the selected date
Grouping: Matches organized by time slots (hours)
Prioritization: Popular leagues (Champions League, Europa League, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga) are shown first
Display Format: Each match shows team logos, names, scores, and match status
Layout: Time-based cards with matches grouped under each time slot
The component fetches comprehensive fixture data for the selected date and presents it in a chronological, time-based view rather than the default country/league grouping.

Query: Fetches fixtures using /api/fixtures/date/${selectedDate}?all=true

Based on your description of the "By time" button functionality, I can see that the TodayMatchByTime component should fetch data and apply the MyPopularLeagueExclusion filters for prioritization. Looking at the current implementation, I can help optimize it to properly use the popular league data filtering.

Let me update the TodayMatchByTime component to better integrate with the popular league exclusion system:

client/src/components/matches/TodayMatchByTime.tsx
Now let me also add a visual indicator for popular leagues in the display:

The updates I've made to the TodayMatchByTime component include:

Replaced exclusion logic: Now uses shouldExcludeFromPopularLeagues and isPopularLeagueSuitable from MyPopularLeagueExclusion.ts for better filtering consistency.

Added popular league prioritization: Matches from popular leagues (Champions League, Premier League, La Liga, etc.) are prioritized in the time-based grouping.

Enhanced sorting algorithm:

Popular leagues appear first within each time slot
Live matches get priority
Major international competitions get special priority
Alphabetical sorting as final tie-breaker
Visual indicators: Added star badges for popular leagues to help users quickly identify high-priority matches.

Improved data structure: Each match now carries an isPopularLeague flag for consistent prioritization throughout the component.

This implementation now properly integrates with your popular league exclusion system and provides the time-based grouping with proper prioritization that matches the requirements you described.

why there is 10:00AM on today match but no score?

div
BA

compitobatam
Assistant
15 hours ago
Looking at the code in TodayMatchByTime.tsx, the "10:00" time display without a score indicates an upcoming match scheduled for 10:00 AM.

The component has different display logic based on match status:

Live matches - Show current score with elapsed time
Finished matches - Show final score with "Ended" status
Upcoming matches - Show scheduled time (like "10:00") without score
The time "10:00" appears because the match status is likely "NS" (Not Started) or "TBD" (To Be Determined), so the component displays the scheduled kickoff time instead of a score.

This is the expected behavior - matches that haven't started yet will show their scheduled time, while live and finished matches will show scores. The match will display a score once it actually begins.

can we make a file special for filter time and date coming from server using this name MyDateConversionFilter?

i want the date coming from server / api still raw without any conversion.
after go through our filter ❌ [DEBUG] Date mismatch (client timezone):

I'll create a specialized date conversion filter file that handles the timezone conversion issue you're experiencing. Looking at your debug output, the issue is that a fixture with UTC date "2025-06-03T22:30:00+00:00" becomes "2025-06-04" in client timezone, but you're filtering for "2025-06-03".

Let me create MyDateConversionFilter.ts that handles this like 365scores.com does - by keeping the server date raw and doing smart timezone-aware filtering:

client/src/lib/MyDateConversionFilter.ts
Now let's update the TodaysMatchesByCountryNew.tsx component to use this new filter:

client/src/components/matches/TodaysMatchesByCountryNew.tsx
The new MyDateConversionFilter handles timezone conversions exactly like 365scores.com:

Raw Server Data: Keeps API dates unchanged from the server
365scores Method: Converts UTC fixture times to user's local timezone for matching
Smart Filtering: Allows fixtures to appear on the correct local date even when UTC date differs
Comprehensive Logging: Shows exactly why fixtures match or don't match
For your example:

Server UTC: 2025-06-03T22:30:00+00:00
Local time: 2025-06-04 (due to timezone)
Selected: 2025-06-03
The filter will now match this fixture to 2025-06-04 in the user's local timezone, solving the mismatch issue you were experiencing.

client/src/components/matches/TodaysMatchesByCountryNew.tsx
Use fallback.svg for country flag fallback to prevent flickering
use fallback.svg for the fallback image when loading so it wont have flickering

lets add logic for date like this :
check the match status, if its not started then compare with current time vs server time example if current time is 2025/06/03T10:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/03T00:30:00AM then its mean it already the past because now is already 10:30AM then label it as yesterday match. but if current time is 2025/06/03T00:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/03T06:30:00AM thats mean its today because its still not past the current time. and if current time is 2025/06/03T00:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/04T02:30:00AM thats mean its yesterday

I'll help you add smart date labeling logic based on match status and time comparison. Let me create a new utility function and update the existing date filter to handle this scenario.

client/src/lib/MySmartDateLabeling.ts
client/src/lib/MyDateConversionFilter.ts
client/src/components/matches/TodaysMatchesByCountryNew.tsx

I can see the image shows two upcoming matches at 06:00:

Sri Lanka vs Brunei
Guinea-Bissau vs Burundi
These appear to be international matches, likely from a World Cup qualifier or similar competition. The matches are scheduled for 06:00, which would be displayed in the user's local timezone.

Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with regarding these matches or the application? For example:

Are the match times displaying correctly?
Do you need help with the flag display or team logos?
Is there an issue with the match data or layout?
Would you like to modify how these matches are presented?
Please let me know what you'd like me to assist with!
