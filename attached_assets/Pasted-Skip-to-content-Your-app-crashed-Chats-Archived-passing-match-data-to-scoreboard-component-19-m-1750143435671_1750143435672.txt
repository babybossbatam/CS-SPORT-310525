how you pass the selected match data to the MyMatchdetailsScoreboard card on the right section?

Looking at your codebase, I can see that the match data is passed to MyMatchdetailsScoreboard through the onMatchCardClick prop. Here's how the data flow works:

Current Data Flow
In TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx (around line 1903), each match card has an onClick handler:
<div
  key={match.fixture.id}
  className="match-card-container group"
  onClick={() => onMatchCardClick?.(match)}
  style={{ cursor: onMatchCardClick ? 'pointer' : 'default' }}
>
The onMatchCardClick prop is passed down from the parent component and expects to receive the full match object.

The match object structure contains:

{
  fixture: { id, date, status, venue },
  league: { id, name, country, logo },
  teams: { home: { id, name, logo }, away: { id, name, logo } },
  goals: { home: number, away: number },
  score: { halftime, fulltime, penalty }
}
How to Connect to MyMatchdetailsScoreboard
To pass the selected match data to MyMatchdetailsScoreboard, you need to:

In the parent component (likely MyMainLayout.tsx or similar), implement the onMatchCardClick handler:
client/src/components/layout/MyMainLayout.tsx
Add state and handler for selected match Add state and handler for selected match Add match click handler Add state and handler for selected match Add match click handler Pass match click handler to component Add state and handler for selected match Add match click handler Pass match click handler to component Add MyMatchdetailsScoreboard to right section
Add the handler function:

Pass the handler to TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew:

In the right section, render MyMatchdetailsScoreboard with the selected match:

This way, when a user clicks on any match card (like "Kyrgyz Republic 22:00 Iran"), the complete match data will be passed to MyMatchdetailsScoreboard and displayed in the right section, replacing the default MyRightContent.

why the match status not using the real time match status?

Looking at your MyMatchdetailsScoreboard.tsx component, I can see the issue. The component is displaying a static elapsed time from the sample data instead of using real-time match status updates.

The problem is in the getStatusBadge function at line 99. Currently, it's using displayMatch.fixture.status.elapsed which comes from the initial API response, but this value doesn't update in real-time.

Here's the fix to make the match status use real-time updates:

client/src/components/matches/MyMatchdetailsScoreboard.tsx
The changes I made:

Added React hooks imports - useState and useEffect for managing live timer state
Added liveElapsed state - Tracks the current elapsed time for live matches
Added useEffect for real-time updates - Initializes with API elapsed time and updates every minute for live matches
Updated getStatusBadge function - Now uses liveElapsed when available, falling back to API elapsed time
Now the match status will show real-time elapsed minutes that increment every minute for live matches, instead of being stuck at the initial API response time. The timer will automatically start for matches with status "1H", "2H", or "LIVE" and stop for non-live matches.

i think the match for world country have a problem with the match data or the conversion to our card content? because the data is wrong when it passed up to MyMatchdetailsScoreboard card

Looking at your code, I can see the issue with the World country match data passing to MyMatchdetailsScoreboard. The problem is in how the World country fixtures are being processed and structured in TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx.

The issue is that when fixtures are grouped by country and the country is "World" or similar international competitions, the data structure gets modified but not consistently. Let me trace the issue:

In TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx, World fixtures get their country changed to different keys like "World", "International", "Europe", "South America"
The league object gets modified: { ...league, country: countryKey }
But MyMatchdetailsScoreboard expects the original fixture structure
Here's the fix:

client/src/components/matches/TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx
The main issues were:

Inconsistent data structure: World country fixtures were getting their structure modified differently than regular country fixtures
Missing required fields: Some fixtures might be missing required fields that MyMatchdetailsScoreboard expects
Incomplete data validation: The code wasn't ensuring all required nested objects existed
The fix ensures that:

All fixtures have a consistent structure regardless of country type
Required fields like fixture.status, goals, score objects are properly structured
Default values are provided for missing optional fields
Team logos have proper fallbacks
This should resolve the issue where World country match data was appearing incorrectly in the MyMatchdetailsScoreboard component.

can you check why Inconsistent data structure: World country fixtures were getting their structure modified differently than regular country fixtures?

Looking at your code and the console logs, I can see the issue with inconsistent data structure for World country fixtures. The problem is in the TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx file where World country fixtures are processed differently than regular country fixtures.

The Issue
In the fixturesByCountry.reduce() function, there are two different paths for processing fixtures:

World/International fixtures (lines ~1850-1900): These get their structure modified with a custom countryKey but don't go through the same data validation and structure normalization as regular fixtures.

Regular country fixtures (lines ~1950+): These go through comprehensive validation and structure normalization with all required fields.

The Fix
The issue is that World fixtures were only getting basic structure updates but missing the comprehensive data validation that regular fixtures receive. Here's the fix:

client/src/components/matches/TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx
What This Fixes
Consistent Structure: Now World fixtures go through the same comprehensive data validation as regular fixtures
Required Fields: Ensures all required fields like fixture.status, goals, score objects are properly structured
Default Values: Provides proper fallbacks for missing optional fields
Team Logo Consistency: Ensures team logos have proper fallback handling
MyMatchdetailsScoreboard Compatibility: World fixtures now have the exact same structure expected by the scoreboard component
This ensures that when you click on a World competition match (like "Romania U19 vs Spain U19" in your UEFA U19 Championship), the data passed to MyMatchdetailsScoreboard will have the same consistent structure as any other match, preventing the data inconsistency issues you were experiencing.

Looking at the error, there's a syntax issue in the TodayPopularFootballLeaguesNew.tsx file around line 1110. The error indicates an unexpected token in a template literal. This is likely due to a syntax error in the string interpolation or a malformed template literal.

Let me fix the syntax error in the toggleFavoriteTeam function:
