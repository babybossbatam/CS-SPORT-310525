check the match status, if its not started then compare with current time vs server time example if current time is 2025/06/03T10:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/03T00:30:00AM then its mean it on the future match and it pass today range time because now is already 10:30AM and today time only until 23:59:59 but its pass 00:00:01 then label it as TOMORROW match. but if we check the match status, if its not started and current time is 2025/06/03T00:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/03T06:30:00AM thats mean its TODAY because its still not past the current time (10:30AM - 23:59PM)). and if we check the match status, if its already ended and current time is 2025/06/03T10:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/03T06:00:00AM thats mean its YESTERDAY Match

Traditional Calendar-Based Labeling:

A match at 00:30 AM on June 3rd would always be labeled "today" if the current date is June 3rd
A match at 23:30 PM on June 2nd would always be labeled "yesterday" if the current date is June 3rd
Smart User-Expectation-Based Labeling:
The new system considers how users actually think about time:

"Today" feels different at different times:

If it's 10:30 AM and there's a match at 00:30 AM the same day, it might feel like "yesterday" to users because it was many hours ago
If it's 02:00 AM and there's a match at 06:00 AM the same day, it still feels like "today"
"Tomorrow" logic for early morning matches:

If it's 10:30 AM today and there's a match at 00:30 AM tomorrow, users might expect it to be labeled "tomorrow" even though technically it's the next calendar day
Context-aware for different match statuses:

Finished matches: A match that finished 6+ hours ago feels like "yesterday" even if it's the same calendar day
Live matches: Use standard calendar logic since they're happening now
Upcoming matches: Use smart time-based logic considering when users would naturally group the match
Example scenarios:
Current time: June 3rd, 10:30 AM
Match scenarios:

Match at June 3rd, 00:30 AM (finished) → "yesterday" (feels like yesterday)
Match at June 3rd, 06:00 AM (finished) → "today" (still feels like today)
Match at June 4th, 00:30 AM (upcoming) → "tomorrow" (future match)
Match at June 3rd, 15:00 PM (upcoming) → "today" (later today)
This makes the interface more intuitive because it matches how people naturally think about time rather than strict calendar boundaries.
