we have smartdate system labeling i want you to modify it like this :

READ PROPERLY BEFORE IMPLEMENT IT!!!
ALWAYS CHECK THE MATCH STATUS FIRST BEFORE check the smart date labeling.
1.	2025/06/03T10:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/03T00:30:00AM then its mean it on the future match and it pass today range time because now is already 10:30AM and today time only until 23:59:59 but its pass 00:00:01 then label it as TOMORROW match
2.	if we check the match status, if its not started and current time is 2025/06/03T00:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/03T06:30:00AM thats mean its TODAY because its still not past the current time (10:30AM - 23:59PM))
3.	if its already ended / finished match and current time is 2025/06/03T10:30:00AM and the fixture date is 2025/06/03T06:00:00AM thats mean its YESTERDAY Match

READ IT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENT IT.
For finished matches: DON'T Use 6-hour threshold for same-day matches but use the time range i show you. its 00:00:01 - 23:59:59

and only applied it to TOdayPopularLeagueNew, TodayMatchByTime, LiveMatchbyallcountry, livematchbytime

The Purpose:
The smart date labeling helps differentiate time periods to properly filter matches that truly belong to each day category:
Why Regular Calendar Filtering Isn't Enough:

Example Scenario:
•	Current time: 2025-06-03 10:30 AM
•	Match time: 2025-06-03 00:30 AM (6 hours ago, same calendar day)
Traditional filtering: Would show this as "Today's match" ❌
Smart filtering: Correctly shows this as "Yesterday's match" ✅
What the Smart System Does:
1.	For "Today" filtering: Only includes matches that still feel relevant to the current day
2.	For "Yesterday" filtering: Catches matches that happened earlier but feel like yesterday
3.	For "Tomorrow" filtering: Properly categorizes future matches

// Instead of showing confusing results like:
"Today's Matches" (at 10:30 AM)
├── Match at 00:30 AM (finished 10 hours ago) ❌ feels like yesterday
├── Match at 15:00 PM (upcoming) ✅ actually today
└── Match at 23:30 PM (upcoming) ✅ actually today

// Smart filtering shows intuitive results:
"Today's Matches" (at 10:30 AM)  
├── Match at 15:00 PM (upcoming) ✅
└── Match at 23:30 PM (upcoming) ✅

"Yesterday's Matches"
└── Match at 00:30 AM (finished 10h ago) ✅

// Fallback to standard date matching
return isFixtureOnClientDate(fixture.fixture.date, selectedDate);
This fallback is allowing matches that should be excluded. When the smart date labeling says a match belongs to "tomorrow" but your selected date is "today", the fallback still includes it if it matches the calendar date.
