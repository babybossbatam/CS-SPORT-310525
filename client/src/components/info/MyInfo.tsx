                  <h3 className="font-medium text-gray-800 my-2 text-xs">Who invented Football?</h3>
                  Football‚Äôs roots go way back! While ball games have been played for centuries across the world, the modern game was shaped in England in the 19th century. The English Football Association set the official rules in 1863, giving us the Football we know and love today.
                  <h3 className="font-medium text-gray-800 my-2 text-xs"> Where was Football invented?</h3>
                  
                  The modern version of Football was born in England. Although similar games existed globally, it was in England where the rules were standardized, making it the home of modern Football.
                  <h3 className="font-medium text-gray-800 my-2 text-xs">What is the length of a Football pitch?</h3>
                  Great question! A standard Football pitch is rectangular, ranging from 90‚Äì120 meters in length and 45‚Äì90 meters in width, as set by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). These dimensions are used for professional and international matches.

                  This is always up for debate! Legends like Pel√©, Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo have all left their mark. Each has a unique style and legacy, so the ‚Äúbest‚Äù often depends on who you ask!
