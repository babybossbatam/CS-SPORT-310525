                      <p>
                        Football's roots go way back! While ball games have been
                        played for centuries across the world, the modern game
                        was shaped in England in the 19th century. The English
                        Football Association set the official rules in 1863,
                        giving us the Football we know and love today.

                        Where was Football invented?
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        The modern version of Football was born in England.
                        Although similar games existed globally, it was in
                        England where the rules were standardized, making it the
                        home of modern Football.

                        What is the length of a Football pitch?
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Great question! A standard Football pitch is
                        rectangular, ranging from 90â€“120 meters in length and
                        45â€“90 meters in width, as set by the International
                        Football Association Board (IFAB). These dimensions are
                        used for professional and international matches.

                        Who is the best Football player in the world?
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        This is always up for debate! Legends like PelÃ©, Diego
                        Maradona, Lionel Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo have all
                        left their mark. Each has a unique style and legacy, so
                        the "best" often depends on who you ask!
